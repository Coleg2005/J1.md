### Question 1

1. What is fault localization?

   The task of using print statements and debuggers to fnd the fault or **problem** in a program that is causing an unexpected output.

2. What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)?
   - Your tests are not biased by your code
   - Writing tests help you think about how you might go about your code
   - Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system

3. Given the example of requirements for generating a password:
   * It must have at least one number.
   * It must have at least one uppercase letter.
   * It must have at least one lowercase letter.
   * It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
   * It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
   
   What are the input domain paritions for this exercise?

      - List of domain partitions:
   
           - If the password breaks one of the requirements

           - If the password follows all of the requirements

           - If the code breaks each one of the requirements alone (should be 5 different cases)

           - If the password is NULL

           - If the password is empty
4. Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:
   
   `if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )`

   | a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible|
   |-------|---|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
   |   T   | T |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   T   | T |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   T   | F |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   T   | F |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   F   | T |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   F   | T |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   F   | F |   T   |         F         |        F          |
   |   F   | F |   F   |         F         |        F          |

5. Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?
   ```java
   paths1[] = [12567,1257,13567,1357,134,1356,135,13,12,1256,125]
   paths2[] = [2567,257,256,25]
   paths3[] = [356,357,3567,35,34]
   paths4[] = [43567,4357,4356,435]
   paths5[] = [567,56,57]
   path6[] = [67]
   ```
   While I listed all paths that did not include a loop, there are infinite paths because of the 3-4 loop.

6. What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class?

   It is very difficult if not impossible to find all the paths for if clauses, predicate outcome, and various inputs that we make test cases around.
   Instead, mutation testing can be done without calcualting every possible path.

### Question 1

1. What is fault localization?

   The task of using print statements and debuggers to fnd the fault or **problem** in a program that is causing an unexpected output.

2. What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)?
   - Your tests are not biased by your code
   - Writing tests help you think about how you might go about your code
   - Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system

3. Given the example of requirements for generating a password:
   * It must have at least one number.
   * It must have at least one uppercase letter.
   * It must have at least one lowercase letter.
   * It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
   * It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
   
   What are the input domain paritions for this exercise?

      - List of domain partitions:
   
           - If the password breaks one of the requirements

           - If the password follows all of the requirements

           - If the code breaks each one of the requirements alone (should be 5 different cases)

           - If the password is NULL

           - If the password is empty
4. Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:
   
   'if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )'

   ------------------------------------------------------------|
   | a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible|
   |-------|---|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
   |   T   | T |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   T   | T |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   T   | F |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   T   | F |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   F   | T |   T   |         T         |        T          |
   |   F   | T |   F   |         F         |        T          |
   |   F   | F |   T   |         F         |        F          |
   |   F   | F |   F   |         F         |        F          |
